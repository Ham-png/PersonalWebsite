                 I am currently collaborating with the <a href="https://purs3lab.github.io/" class="link-effect">Purdue Systems and Software Security Lab</a> (PurS3) on creating a 
                 C to Rust dataset called C2R. This project, led by Professor <a href="https://machiry.github.io/" class="link-effect">Aravind Machiry</a>, focuses on converting C code to 
                 idiomatic, safe Rust code to enhance code security by eliminating the use of unsafe 
                 code constructs inherent in C, thereby mitigating associated security vulnerabilities.

                I served as a Firmware Engineering Intern during my internship at <a href="https://neurava.com/" class="link-effect">Neurava</a> in the summer of 2022. 
                In this role, I was responsible for developing firmware for a cutting-edge smart wearable device 
                designed to track the vital signs of individuals at risk of SUDEP (Sudden Unexpected Death in Epilepsy).

                During the fall semester of 2022, I worked as an Undergraduate Teaching Assistant, providing guidance and support to 
                students in the Advanced C Programming course. My responsibilities included conducting office hours, 
                reviewing course materials, and proctoring exams.

                I worked on evaluating YOLO-based image processing algorithms to detect and label brain tumors, 
                focusing on improving detection accuracy and processing speed. By leveraging the <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ahmedhamada0/brain-tumor-detection" class="link-effect">Br35H dataset</a>, 
                I conducted a comparative analysis against baseline YOLO versions like YOLOv6 and YOLOv7, 
                demonstrating the effectiveness of these models in medical imaging applications.

                during the spring semester of 2023, I developed a TypeScript-based frontend for users to upload, 
                update, rate, and manipulate GitHub packages. Additionally, I implemented JavaScript-based backend 
                features for user authentication, data manipulation, database integration, and dynamic functionality.

                I played a key role in developing the code

                I developed a Java compiler that handles C-like code and supports advanced features like while 
                loops, for loops, and extensive 3AC functionality. The project involved modifying 
                the code generation process to handle these conversions effectively, incorporating 
                custom instructions for seamless conversion between integers and floating-point numbers.

                I worked on the Operating System Project, where I constructed a Unix-like operating 
                system from scratch using C. The project focused on developing a functional OS by incorporating 
                concepts from basic JOS and adapting it to meet modern standards. I conducted thorough documentation and 
                analysis at each milestone to address coding errors and track the progress of the kernel.
